= How to compile and flash the code =


How to compile and flash arduino code is documented many times on the web.

A good entry point is here: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/Cfg_Update_Firmware

But don't use their hex file of course, but compile the right one for minNAZAOSD.

And use the 'OSD Config Tool' from my code section trunk/Tools, it's the same as of my other project minOPOSD.
