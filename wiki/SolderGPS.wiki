For using the NAZA GPS you have to solder one wire to it.

There are some descriptions and videos on the web how to do it, so here I only show some pictures as an abstract.

----

First open the GPS with a Torx T5 bit:

----

Then carefully solder the cable:

You need a little notch to let the cable out of the GPS.

After that close and screw the GPS.

----

For connecting the GPS data wire to the OSD and to power the OSD you have to solder an adaptor cable as shown here:

----

Connection is done like shown in the following pictures:

(shown without the LED adaptor and without the minNAZAOSD soldering for simplicity)

As you can see in this pictures, the minNAZAOSD is powered through the NAZA +5V and GND (red and brown cables) and the GPS data is feeded by the third cable.
