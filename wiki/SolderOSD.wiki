Since I own the old version V0.1 of the MinimOSD with the heating problem, I first of all desoldered the capacitor to isolate the 12V from the OSD and powered it from the 5V side.

In the following two pictures you can see how to do so.

Shown above is an unsoldered MinimOSD and below a soldered MinimOSD.

Desolder the capacitor (red rectangle) to isolate the 12V from the OSD.

Solder the two solder jumper (green rectangles) to powered the MAX7456 chip from the 5V side.

The following is the hardest stuff to do for this OSD.

Only do this if you have some very good soldering skills.

Also only do this if you have the knowledge of what you are doing. 

For connecting the LED adaptor, the RSSI, the voltage/current sensor and the things for the artificial horizon, screen switching and throttle percentage you have to solder the things shown in blue in the following diagram:

The software realization for the gimbal F1/F2, screenswitch and throttle is not ready yet and it's currently not proven for functionality!

The rest is not that hard.
